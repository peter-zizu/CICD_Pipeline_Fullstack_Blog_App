## 🏗️ Architecture
The pipeline follows a **DevOps best practices workflow**, integrating with various tools for:
- Continuous Integration (CI)
- Continuous Deployment (CD)
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Monitoring and Logging

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Version Control**: GitHub
- **CI/CD Orchestration**: Jenkins/GitHub Actions
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Terraform
- **Cloud Platform**: AWS/Azure/GCP
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack

## 🛤️ Pipeline Stages
1. **Code Build and Static Code Analysis**
2. **Unit Testing and Integration Testing**
3. **Containerization and Artifact Storage**
4. **Infrastructure Provisioning (IaC)**
5. **Continuous Deployment**
6. **Monitoring and Logging**

## ✅ Prerequisites
- Docker installed
- Terraform CLI
- Access to cloud provider (AWS, Azure, or GCP)
- GitHub account
